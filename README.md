Welcome to my portfolio website! This is my first website, which I built using HTML and CSS.

The purpose of this website is to showcase my work and skills as a developer. I have included examples of my previous projects, as well as information about my education and experience.

I chose to use HTML and CSS because they are the foundation of web development and I wanted to gain a solid understanding of these languages. I also found that using these languages allowed me to create a website that is clean and easy to navigate.

I hope that you enjoy exploring my website and learning more about my background and abilities. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
